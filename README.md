# Code run execution 
//************ instructions on how to run code ******************//

//----------------------------------- Requirements-----------------------------------------//
visual studio IDE (Ideally 2022)
C# (4.8)
Desktop or PC
Prior knowledge with C# coding
The downloaded zip file
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

 * start off by logging in to visual studio 2022 (install Visual Studio: Download and install the latest version of Visual Studio from visualstudio.microsoft.com.)
   
 *  unzip the project folder
 *  Open sln code in visual studio
 * press build and run (The green play icon) 
 * the app will prompt you to add in certain information which is a sequential and guided process
 * there is a lot of exceptionhandling so it is particularly forgiving
 * once all data is captured you will be redirected to a menu system. 
 * This menu system will provide you with a series of options 
 * choose from any of these options by inputing the corresponding number

//------------------------------ Changes ---------------------------//
Kashvir Sewpersad ST10257503

I've improved my part one code in a few areas in response to my lecturer's comments. First, I improved the codebase's robustness by providing better exception handling throughout, which addressed inadequate error handling. In addition, I added color to the output system, which enhances visual clarity and adds interest to the interface. Additionally, by indenting the code, I've made it easier to read and maintain. To improve user experience and make interactions more friendly, I've also incorporated a personalized greeting for users. Even while the code isn't perfect, these improvements show that it has come a long way in terms of quality and usefulness. Lastly, I'm trying to make the ReadMe documentation better so that users may find more precise assistance and instructions. I believe to have addressed my shortcomings with regards to the requirements based on the above mentioned details.
